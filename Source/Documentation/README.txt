This contains only the core source of the forum scripts before I then add the bootstrap, font awesome, tinymce and switch elements.


These source folders are here for development purposes for if and or whenever I may have free time to look at this further and then such when I may make changes to the core source and then eventually will implement such to the actual OpenForum 1 & 2 "Upload" directories.


OpenForum-Source = The topics & posts original OpenForum source

OpenForum2-Source = The Categories, topics & posts variant of original OpenForum source


Note: as these are base sources for development changes and as such does not include any of the bootstrap, font awesome or light switch implementations yet, please understand that any changes found here may not yet be implemented into the OpenForum Upload Directories.
